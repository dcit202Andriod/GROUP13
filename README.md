# GROUP13
Hello, we are Group 13!
We created an app called Resident (thank you Nadia and Bel.)
Resident shows you hostels on campus and allows you to book rooms in them.
We created it to make the experience of hostel booking an interactive and user friendly one.
Each group member will now introduce thrmselves and state their contribution to the project.

My name is Kwame Anderson. I acted as the group leader for this project.
I was also responsible for creating the screens for
the User Profile, Personal Information and Reviews. I also wrote the logic vehind those screens.
