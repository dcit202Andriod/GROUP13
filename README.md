# App overview
The app works by providing users with a platform to search for and book hostels on campus. Here is an overview of how the app typically functions:
1.Before the user can acess the hostels he/she needs to login or sign up if he/she is new a new user
2.After sucessful registration the app redirects the user to the hostel listings.Each hostel listing will provide detailed information about the hostel,including photos.
3.Once users have chosen a hostel, they can proceed to book their stay directly through the app. The app will typically provide a secure payment gateway for users to complete their booking
4.Users can also input their personal information,edit them anytime and view their reservations under the user profile

Hello, we are Group 13!
We created an app called Resident (thank you Nadia and Bel.)
Resident shows you hostels on campus and allows you to book rooms in them.
We created it to make the experience of hostel booking an interactive and user-friendly one.
Each group member will now introduce themselves and state their contribution to the project.
